# Summary Course "JavaScript - The Complete Guide 2022 (Beginner + Advanced)" (Udemy)

- JavaScript:
  - is `dynamic`, i.e. coda can change at runtime (e.g. type of a variable)
  - is `weakly typed`, i.e. data types are assumed (e.g. assigned to variables) automatically and can change
    - you don't define that some variable has to hold a certain value (e.g. `number`)
  - is `interpreted`, i.e. it's on the fly `compiled and executed at runtime`
  - is a `hosted` language, i.e. it runs in different `host environments`
    - `browser` (client-side): JS can manipulate HTML, CSS, send background HTTP requests etc.; JS can NOT access local filesystem, interact with operating system
    - `Node.js` (server-side): used to build web backends; can access local filesystem, interact with operating system; can NOT manipulate HTML, CSS
