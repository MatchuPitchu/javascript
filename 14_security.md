# Security in JavaScript Code

- security details in your code:
  - your JavaScript code can be read by anyone
  - security-relevant details can be read
  - attackers may be able to abuse exposed data
  - example: database access credentials exposed in code on client-side
- `cross-site scripting attacks` (XSS)
  - attack pattern where malicious JS code gets injected and executed
- `cross-site request forgery` (CSRF)
- `cross-origin resource sharing` (CORS)
